# DataInertia

**DataInertia** is a lightweight framework designed to optimize datasets for machine learning workflows. It streamlines data preprocessing, cleaning, feature engineering, and reporting, making it easy to build robust pipelines for any dataset.

## Key Features
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Normalize and scale numeric features.
  - Encode categorical variables (one-hot or label encoding).
  - Handle missing values with imputation.
- **Cleaning:**
  - Identify and remove duplicate rows.
  - Detect and handle outliers (IQR or Z-score methods).
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Generate polynomial features and interaction terms.
  - Scale features using Min-Max or Standard scaling.
- **Pipelines:**
  - Build preprocessing pipelines.
  - Seamlessly integrate with machine learning models.
- **Reporting:**
  - Generate PDF summary reports.
  - Visualize missing data with heatmaps.
  - Create diagnostics files with dataset insights.

## Quick Start
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
